A brief note on some choices: I use Apple’s Terminal.app as my terminal emulator for its simplicity and low configuration requirements. For personal productivity, Apple’s Calendar, Notes, Mail, and Reminders apps keep me organized and focused without complexity.

## Workstation

### 14" MacBook Pro, M3 Pro, 18GB RAM

The 14" MacBook Pro with M3 Pro is the cornerstone of my professional setup. It excels in web development, native application building, and occasional video editing. The M3 Pro delivers exceptional performance and efficiency, handling video rendering swiftly, often without triggering the cooling fans. The fans only kicked in once when maxing out graphics settings in *Lies of P*. I rely on the MacBook’s built-in trackpad and keyboard for their precision and comfort, eliminating the need for external monitors or peripherals. The speakers also stand out, providing clear, immersive sound.

## Development Tools

### Vim

Vim is my go-to text editor due to its speed, flexibility, and customization. Its lightweight design boosts efficiency, and since it’s pre-installed on macOS and widely available on servers, I enjoy a consistent editing experience across environments. Recently, I’ve embraced a plugin-free setup to keep things minimal and distraction-free.

### Deno

For TypeScript projects, I use Deno as my runtime environment. Its emphasis on security, performance, and built-in tools—such as formatting, linting, and testing—streamlines development. I frequently pair Deno with the Fresh framework, which integrates seamlessly and offers a modern, dependable foundation for building high-quality web applications.
